structure order/offsets
offsets that point into another structure
offsets that point outside the file structure
indexed structures

BG1/BGEE has offset 0xc0 at 0 if there are no rest encounters;
in which case there is no corresponding structure; problem
for both minimum-size check and offsets check

AR2600 BGEE has explored bitmap

BG2EE OH7300.are fails the size test with 4 bytes more than expected;
NI says it's ok
